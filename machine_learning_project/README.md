# Machine Learning Prediction Project  
## Supervised Learning for Predictive Modeling

---

## 📌 Overview

This project applies **Supervised Machine Learning** techniques to build predictive models using historical data.

The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights by training a model capable of generating reliable predictions to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Organizations frequently rely on historical datasets to forecast future outcomes such as performance, demand, or risk.

This project addresses the challenge of:
- Preparing structured data for modeling
- Training supervised learning algorithms
- Generating prediction outputs
- Organizing results for analysis and validation
